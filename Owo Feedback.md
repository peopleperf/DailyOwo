## Calculation & Logic Issues

### 1. ‚ùå Inconsistent Financial Health Score Weights

**Status**: VERIFIED ‚úì  
**Files Affected**: 
- `Work.md` (line 315)
- `lib/financial-logic/financial-health-logic.ts`
- `components/ui/FinancialHealthModal.tsx`

**Issue**: 
Documentation shows Net Worth as 25% weight, but code uses 30%.

**Evidence**:
```typescript
// In Work.md:
1. **Net Worth Score** (25%):

// In financial-health-logic.ts:
componentScores.netWorth * 0.3 +      // 30% weight
```

**Fix Required**: 
Update Work.md to reflect the correct 30% weight for Net Worth component.

---

### 2. ‚ùå Division by Zero - Net Worth Ratio

**Status**: VERIFIED ‚úì  
**File**: `lib/financial-logic/financial-health-logic.ts`

**Issue**: 
```typescript
const ratio = netWorth / totalAssets;
```
Only checks if `totalAssets === 0` AFTER attempting division.

**Fix Required**: 
Move the zero check before the division operation.

---

### 3. ‚ùå Division by Zero - Income Calculations

**Status**: VERIFIED ‚úì  
**Files**: 
- `lib/financial-logic/income-logic.ts`
- `lib/financial-logic/savings-rate-logic.ts`
- `lib/financial-logic/debt-ratio-logic.ts`
- `lib/financial-logic/expenses-logic.ts`

**Issue**: 
Multiple calculations divide by income without consistent zero checks:
- Savings rate: `(totalSavings / totalIncome) * 100`
- Debt ratio: `(monthlyDebtPayments / monthlyIncome) * 100`
- Expense ratio: `data.totalExpenses / data.totalIncome`
- Income stability: `(recurringIncome / totalIncome) >= 0.7`

**Fix Required**: 
Add consistent zero checks before all division operations.

---

### 4. ‚ùå Goal Progress Calculation - Negative Months

**Status**: VERIFIED ‚úì  
**Files**: 
- `components/goals/GoalCard.tsx`
- `components/goals/AddGoalModal.tsx`

**Issue**: 
```typescript
const monthsRemaining = goal.monthlyContribution > 0 
  ? Math.ceil(remaining / goal.monthlyContribution)
  : 0;
```
Doesn't handle cases where target date has passed or monthlyContribution is insufficient.

**Fix Required**: 
Add checks for past target dates and handle edge cases properly.

---

### 5. ‚ùå Debt Payoff Timeline - Incorrect Formula

**Status**: VERIFIED ‚úì  
**File**: `lib/financial-logic/debt-ratio-logic.ts`

**Issue**: 
Uses simplified calculation instead of standard amortization formula:
```typescript
// Current simplified approach
const months = Math.log(1 + (balance * monthlyRate) / monthlyPayment) / Math.log(1 + monthlyRate);
```

**Fix Required**: 
Implement standard loan amortization formula with proper edge case handling.

---

### 6. ‚ùå Portfolio Return - No Weight Normalization

**Status**: VERIFIED ‚úì  
**File**: `lib/financial-logic/networth-logic.ts`

**Issue**: 
Asset weights are not normalized before calculating portfolio returns. Current implementation doesn't ensure weights sum to 1.

**Fix Required**: 
Add weight normalization before portfolio calculations.

---

### 7. ‚ùå Emergency Fund Calculations - Division by Zero

**Status**: VERIFIED ‚úì  
**File**: `app/[locale]/emergency-fund/page.tsx`

**Issue**: 
```typescript
const monthlySavingsNeeded = remainingAmount / 12;
```
No check if remainingAmount could lead to issues or if monthly savings is feasible.

**Fix Required**: 
Add validation and feasibility checks.

---

### 8. ‚ùå Transaction Filtering - Sign Consistency

**Status**: VERIFIED ‚úì  
**Files**: Multiple transaction-related files

**Issue**: 
All expense transactions are stored and filtered as positive amounts throughout the codebase, which is inconsistent with typical accounting practices.

**Evidence**:
- Expenses are never stored as negative values
- All filtering assumes positive amounts for expenses

**Fix Required**: 
Document the convention clearly or migrate to standard accounting practices.

---

### 9. ‚ùå Analytics Trend Calculation - Division by Zero

**Status**: VERIFIED ‚úì  
**File**: `lib/financial-logic/expenses-logic.ts`

**Issue**: 
```typescript
const changePercentage = ((amount - previousAmount) / previousAmount) * 100;
```
No check if previousAmount is zero.

**Fix Required**: 
Add zero checks for all percentage change calculations.

---

### 10. ‚ùå Hardcoded Net Worth Target Formula

**Status**: VERIFIED ‚úì - FIXED ‚úÖ  
**File**: `Work.md`

**Issue**: 
```typescript
const targetNetWorth = (age - 25) * annualIncome * 0.5;

**Fix Required**: 
- Enforce exclusive transaction types
- Add type validation at data layer
- Create type migration tools for existing data

---

### 33. ‚ùå No Multi-User Conflict Detection

Weak input validation allows bad data entry (negative income, future-dated expenses, impossible values).

**Fix Required**: 
- Strengthen input validation rules
- Add contextual validation (e.g., expense can't exceed income by 1000%)
- Create validation error messages

**Fix Implemented**:

---

## üìå Key Insights from Additional Analysis

The deep dive into data flow and calculation dependencies revealed that DailyOwo has **fundamental data integrity issues** beyond the initial calculation bugs:

1. **No Single Source of Truth Protection**: The app relies entirely on transaction integrity with no safeguards
2. **Calculation Cascade Risk**: One bad transaction can corrupt all financial metrics
3. **Multi-User Data Corruption**: Family sharing has no conflict resolution
4. **Silent Failures**: Calculations fail without user notification
5. **No Reconciliation**: Users can't verify their data matches reality

These issues suggest the app needs a **data integrity overhaul** before it can be considered production-ready for managing real financial data.

### Recommended Data Flow Architecture

```
User Input ‚Üí Validation ‚Üí Local State ‚Üí Sync Queue ‚Üí Firestore
                ‚Üì              ‚Üì            ‚Üì           ‚Üì
            Error UI     Calculations   Conflict    Audit Log
                          ‚Üì              Detection      ‚Üì
                    Integrity Check        ‚Üì       Historical
