## Debugging Log & Current Status

### `lib/financial-logic/debt-ratio-logic.ts`
- **Initial Review & Fixes (Completed based on Checkpoint Summary):**
    - Reviewed the module and the `Transaction` type to understand its structure (e.g., usage of `categoryId` vs. `category`).
    - Previous edits (as per checkpoint) addressed some `categoryId` issues and missing properties in return objects for `calculateDebtRatioData`.
- **Targeted Function Fixes (In Progress):**
    - Currently focused on comprehensive corrections for `calculateDebtRatioData` and `getDebtBreakdown`.
    - **`calculateDebtRatioData`:** The objective is to ensure this function correctly calls `calculateDebtMetrics` and utilizes its return values (like `debtPayoffTime`, `totalInterestCost`, `averageInterestRate`, `highestInterestDebt`), replacing any placeholder values.
    - **`getDebtBreakdown`:** The objective is to rectify the loop logic for accurately grouping debts by category, calculating `totalDebt` and `totalMinimumPayments`, and correctly deriving `debtByPriority` for avalanche and snowball payoff strategies.
    - An attempt to apply these fixes via `replace_file_content` was made, but the operation was cancelled by the user. These specific corrections are still pending successful application.
- **Next Steps for this file (aligns with current plan):**
    - Re-attempt the application of the corrected `calculateDebtRatioData` and `getDebtBreakdown` functions.
    - Verify that all TypeScript errors within this file are resolved post-correction.

### `components/onboarding/FinancialSnapshotStep.tsx` (Onboarding Financial Preview)
- **Initial State:** Calculations for monthly savings, savings rate, and net worth were performed directly within the component using basic arithmetic on user-inputted summary figures (`monthlyIncome`, `monthlyExpenses`, `currentSavings`, `currentDebt`).
- **Objective:** Refactor to use centralized financial logic for consistency, as requested by the user, without altering the UI/design.
- **Investigation:**
    - Reviewed core logic modules (`financial-health-logic.ts`, `savings-rate-logic.ts`, `networth-logic.ts`).
    - These modules are designed for more complex, transaction-based analysis and were not directly suitable for the simple, summary-based calculations needed in this onboarding step without significant adaptation or passing of full transaction arrays (which are not available at this stage).
- **Solution Implemented:**
    - Created a new utility file: `lib/financial-logic/quick-preview-logic.ts`.
    - Defined three simple helper functions in this new file:
        - `calculateQuickNetWorth(currentSavings: number, currentDebt: number): number`
        - `calculateQuickMonthlySavings(monthlyIncome: number, monthlyExpenses: number): number`
        - `calculateQuickSavingsRate(monthlyIncome: number, monthlySavings: number): number`
    - Updated `FinancialSnapshotStep.tsx`:
        - Imported the new helper functions from `quick-preview-logic.ts`.
        - Modified the `useEffect` hook to use these imported functions for calculating `monthlySavings`, `savingsRate`, and `netWorth`, replacing the direct arithmetic.
- **Status:**
    - The financial preview calculations in the onboarding step are now centralized in `lib/financial-logic/quick-preview-logic.ts`.
    - The component's UI and user-facing functionality remain unchanged.
    - Lint errors related to missing imports for these functions have been resolved by correctly adding the import statements.
    - Verification of calculations by the user is the next step for this component.

## Key Findings from `TransactionBudgetSyncService.syncTransactionWithBudget`:
- **Transaction Update Handling**: For `eventType: 'update'`, it correctly recalculates the spending for an affected budget category by fetching all transactions for the budget period and then calling `calculateCategorySpending`. This avoids issues with delta calculations if, for example, a transaction's category also changed.

## Key Findings from `lib/financial-logic/expenses-logic.ts` (Full Review):
- Primarily an analytical module for *post-categorization* expense analysis.
- Relies on `Transaction.category` being pre-assigned.
- Introduces its own higher-level expense groupings (Fixed, Variable, etc.) separate from budget categories.
- `ExpenseCategory.budgetStatus` has a `TODO` indicating it's not currently integrated with live budget data within this module; this comparison must happen elsewhere (e.g., in `financial-dashboard-service.ts`).

## Key Findings from `lib/financial-logic/financial-health-logic.ts` (Full Review):
- Calculates overall financial health using aggregated transaction data.
- Income/Expenses are period-specific for flow calculations (monthly income/expense).
- Assets/Liabilities use *all* transactions for an accurate snapshot of current net worth.
- Asset valuation considers `assetDetails.currentPrice * assetDetails.quantity` or falls back to `transaction.amount`.
- Does not perform budget-specific categorization; consumes already typed/categorized transactions.

## Key Findings from `lib/firebase/budget-service.ts`:
- Handles all Firestore CRUD operations for budgets (users/{userId}/budgets collection).
- `createBudget` uses `createBudgetFromMethod` (from `budget-logic.ts`) to generate budget structure based on income and selected method.
- `initializeUserBudget` is key for new users; fetches profile income and calls `createBudget`.
- `createInitialTransactionsFromProfile` can create initial transactions from onboarding data.
- `getBudgetData` fetches a budget and ALL user transactions, then calls `calculateBudgetData` (from `budget-logic.ts`) for comprehensive calculations.
- `updateBudget` and `updateBudgetCategory` persist changes to Firestore. It expects the *final state* of budget/category data, implying that `TransactionBudgetSyncService` must calculate the correct new totals before calling update.
- Provides real-time subscription methods (`subscribeToActiveBudget`).

## Next Steps Planned:
    - **Deep Dive & Confirmation:**
        - [x] Re-examine `TransactionBudgetSyncService.syncTransactionWithBudget` - Confirmed it recalculates category spending from all period transactions on update.
    - **Broaden Review (View Full Content):**
        - [x] `lib/financial-logic/expenses-logic.ts` (view full content).
        - [x] `lib/financial-logic/financial-health-logic.ts` (view full content).
    - **Synthesize & Analyze:**
        - [x] Consolidate the data flow map for how budgets receive and categorize data for income, expenses, assets, and debts.
        - [ ] Formally list identified logical flaws, miscalculations, or unhandled edge cases.
    - **Propose Solutions:**
        - [ ] Develop mitigation strategies for any issues found.
    - **Documentation:**
        - Continue updating `scratchpad.md`.

## Current Goal
Verify onboarding financial calculations in `FinancialSnapshotStep.tsx` and then proceed to the next task (e.g., resume work on `debt-ratio-logic.ts` or address new user requests).
- [x] Review and update all UX content (labels, instructions, error messages) across authentication, onboarding, and main app flows to ensure alignment with UX_CONTENT_PATTERNS.md and DESIGN_PHILOSOPHY.md.
  - [x] Review Login Page UX content and alignment (`app/[locale]/auth/login/page.tsx`)
  - [x] Review Registration Page UX content and alignment (`app/[locale]/auth/register/page.tsx`)
  - [x] Review Onboarding Steps UX content and alignment:
    - [x] `CurrencyStep.tsx`
    - [x] `FinancialSnapshotStep.tsx`
    - [x] `GoalsStep.tsx`
    - [x] `InvestmentsStep.tsx`
    - [x] `FamilyStep.tsx`
    - [x] `ProfileStep.tsx`
    - [x] `PreferencesStep.tsx`
    - [x] `CompletionStep.tsx`
  - [ ] Review main app flows UX content (post-onboarding)
  - [ ] Design and implement password reset flow (request, email, reset page) - *UX content review for this pending implementation*

## UX Content Review - Onboarding Flow (Steps 1-8) Summary:
*   **General Theme**: Most onboarding steps (`CurrencyStep`, `FinancialSnapshotStep`, `GoalsStep`, `InvestmentsStep`, `FamilyStep`, `ProfileStep`, `PreferencesStep`, `CompletionStep`) feature clear, user-friendly English text. The primary and consistent recommendation across all steps is the **need for comprehensive localization**. Many components contain hardcoded strings for titles, subtitles, labels, button texts, instructional messages, array-defined options (like investment types, family roles, permissions), and error messages.
*   **Key Recommendations**:
    *   **Localize All Text**: Systematically move all user-facing strings to `next-intl` translation files (e.g., `en/onboarding.json`, `en/common.json`). This includes:
        *   Page/Step Titles & Subtitles
        *   Form Field Labels & Placeholders
        *   Button Texts (navigation, action buttons)
        *   Instructional Text & Helper Texts
        *   Error Messages (ensure tone is helpful and calm)
        *   Content within data arrays (e.g., `investmentTypes` in `InvestmentsStep`, `roleOptions` in `FamilyStep`, `NOTIFICATIONS` in `PreferencesStep`)
        *   Conditional text and dynamic string templates (e.g., in `CompletionStep`).
    *   **Consistency**:
        *   **Form Labels**: Decide on a consistent style (e.g., sentence case vs. ALL CAPS as per `UX_CONTENT_PATTERNS.md` for "Form Labels: Field labels: Uppercase with tracking"). Apply consistently across all forms.
        *   **Error Message Styling**: Ensure consistent color and presentation for error messages.
    *   **Clarity & Tone**:
        *   Maintain the generally positive, reassuring, and benefit-oriented tone observed in the English copy.
        *   Soften error message wording where appropriate (e.g., "Please enter..." instead of "X is required").
    *   **Specific Component Notes**:
        *   `CurrencyStep`, `FinancialSnapshotStep`, `GoalsStep`: Generally good structure; primary need is localization. `FinancialSnapshotStep`'s "Why we ask" is a good pattern.
        *   `InvestmentsStep`: Good two-stage approach. Investment type names and descriptions need localization.
        *   `FamilyStep`: This is a feature-rich step. All form elements, role names, permission descriptions, and validation errors require careful localization.
        *   `ProfileStep`: Straightforward. The privacy notice is well-placed. All text needs localization.
        *   `PreferencesStep`: Already utilizes `useTranslations` for some parts. The `NOTIFICATIONS` array content, section titles, and "Recommended" badge text are key items for localization.
        *   `CompletionStep`: Highly dynamic with personalized financial summaries and recommendations. All text elements, including titles, subtitles, conditional messages, insight card text (titles, subtitles, units like "months"), recommendation templates, and "Coming Soon" features, need to be localized using interpolated variables. The "Welcome, {name}!" greeting needs a translatable prefix.

## Proposed Mitigation Strategies (Initial):

**For Issue 1: Custom Transaction Categories & Budget Mapping**
*   **Unmapped Custom Categories:**
    1.  *UI/UX Enhancement:* Prompt users to link new custom `TransactionCategory` to a `BudgetCategory` upon creation.
    2.  *Default "Catch-All" Budget Category:* Implement a default budget category for unmapped transactions.
    3.  *Dedicated Report/View:* Show transactions not contributing to any budget category.
*   **Orphaned Mappings:**
    1.  *Data Integrity Check:* System utility to scan and verify `BudgetCategory.transactionCategories` against `transaction-categories.ts`.
    2.  *Alerting & Resolution UI:* Flag orphaned IDs and guide admin/user for re-mapping.
    3.  *Preventative Measures:* Warn on `TransactionCategory` deletion/modification if used in budgets.

**For Issue 2: Transaction Updates (Category Change)**
*   **Mitigation/Verification:**
    1.  *Explicit Recalculation for Old Category:* In `TransactionBudgetSyncService` (on 'update'), after handling the new budget category, explicitly identify and trigger recalculation for the budget category associated with `oldTransaction.category`.
    2.  Ensure `calculateCategorySpending` always sums all relevant period transactions for the target budget category.
    3.  Include updates for both old and new budget categories in the Firestore batch write.

**For Issue 3: Asset/Liability Transactions in Budgets**
*   **Clarity of Savings/Investment Budget Categories:**
    1.  *Informative UI:* Use tooltips/descriptions to explain how these categories aggregate expenses and assets.
    2.  *Transaction Breakdown:* Allow users to view transaction lists for these categories, distinguishing between expense and asset contributions.
*   **Asset Sales/Realization:**
    1.  *Guided Transaction Entry:* For asset sales, guide users to record sale amount, cost basis, and auto-categorize gain/loss as income/expense for the budget.
    2.  *Separate Tracking Option:* Optionally keep realized gains/losses separate from operational budgets, primarily reflecting in net worth, with clear user communication.
    3.  *User Choice:* Allow users to decide if realized gains are budget income.
*   **Debt Principal vs. Payments:**
    1.  *Clarify Budget Scope:* Emphasize that "Debt Payments" budget category tracks payment *expenses*.
    2.  *Link to Liability (Informational):* Optionally link debt payment budget categories to liability records to display remaining principal for context.
    3.  *Handling Lump-Sum Payments:* Ensure large principal paydown expenses are categorized to hit the budget appropriately.

**For Issue 4: Rollover Logic Implementation Details**
*   **Mitigation/Verification:**
    1.  *End-of-Period Process:* Define an automated or user-triggered process to calculate `remaining = allocated - spent` and apply this as `rolloverAmount` to the next period's category allocation.
    2.  *Clear UI Display:* Show base allocation, rollover amount, and effective total allocation in budget views.
    3.  *User Configuration:* Allow per-category settings for rollover (enable/disable, caps, negative rollover).
    4.  *Audit Trail:* Record rollover calculations.

**For Issue 5: Initial Budget Setup with Existing Transactions**
*   **Mitigation/Verification:**
    1.  *Retroactive Calculation on Budget Creation:* When a budget is created, `budgetService.createBudget` should fetch existing transactions for the first period and calculate initial `spent` amounts.
    2.  *User Prompt for Backfill:* Optionally, prompt user to scan existing transactions for the new budget period.
    3.  *Dedicated "Recalculate Budget" Function:* Allow manual triggering of full budget recalculation for a period.

**For Issue 6: `expenses-logic.ts` `budgetStatus` TODO**
*   **Mitigation/Verification:**
    1.  *Integration in `financial-dashboard-service.ts` (or similar):* This service should fetch data from both `expenses-logic.ts` and `budget-service.ts`, then combine them to accurately populate `ExpenseCategory.budgetStatus` before UI presentation.
    2.  *Alternative (less favored):* Modify `expenses-logic.ts` functions to optionally accept `Budget` data to perform the comparison internally.

**For Issue 7: Data Integrity for Category Definitions**
*   **Mitigation/Verification:**
    1.  *Validation on `BudgetCategory` Create/Update:* Validate `transactionCategories` IDs against existing `TransactionCategory.id`s.
    2.  *Validation on `TransactionCategory` Update/Delete:* Check for usage in `BudgetCategory.transactionCategories` and warn/prompt for re-mapping.
    3.  *Periodic Integrity Scans:* Admin utility to find and flag discrepancies between `BudgetCategory.transactionCategories` and master `TransactionCategory` list.

**For Issue 8: Performance of Recalculations**
*   **Mitigation/Verification:**
    1.  *Delta-Based Updates (Conditional):* Use delta updates for transaction creations, deletions, and updates where the category doesn't change. Full recalculation if category changes or data consistency is suspect.
    2.  *Optimized `calculateCategorySpending`:* Ensure efficient filtering within this function.
    3.  *Debouncing/Batching Updates:* Consider for rapid, successive changes before events hit backend sync.
    4.  *Background Recalculation Option:* For very large datasets, offer eventual consistency for less critical updates.
    5.  *Archiving Old Budget Periods:* Finalize `spent` amounts for closed periods to reduce recalculation scope.

**For Issue 9: Time Zone and Date Handling**
*   **Mitigation/Verification:**
    1.  *Store Dates in UTC:* All backend dates should be UTC.
    2.  *Convert to User's Time Zone for Display:* Use user's profile time zone for UI.
    3.  *Consistent Date Libraries:* Use a robust date library (e.g., `date-fns`, `Luxon`).
    4.  *Define Period Boundaries Clearly:* Use precise UTC start/end times for budget periods and queries.
    5.  *Testing:* Test across time zones and DST changes.

## UX Content Review - Onboarding Flow (Steps 1-8) Summary:

All text elements, including titles, subtitles, conditional messages, insight card text (titles, subtitles, units like "months"), recommendation templates, and "Coming Soon" features, need to be localized using interpolated variables. The "Welcome, {name}!" greeting needs a translatable prefix.

## Potential Issues & Areas for Scrutiny (Previously Identified):

1.  **Custom Transaction Categories & Budget Mapping:**
    *   **Unmapped Custom Categories:** Transactions with custom categories not linked to any `BudgetCategory.transactionCategories` might be excluded from budget calculations.
    *   **Orphaned Mappings:** Changes/deletions in `transaction-categories.ts` could leave stale IDs in `BudgetCategory.transactionCategories`.

2.  **Transaction Updates (Category Change):**
    *   Need to ensure that if a transaction's own `category` changes, spending in *both* the old and new budget categories is correctly recalculated. The current full-period recalculation for the *new* category should implicitly handle this if `calculateCategorySpending` is comprehensive, but worth verifying.

3.  **Asset/Liability Transactions in Budgets:**
    *   **Clarity of Savings/Investment Budget Categories:** The unique aggregation (expenses + assets) for these budget categories needs clear user communication.
    *   **Asset Sales/Realization:** The flow for how proceeds from asset sales (and any gains/losses) impact budgets (e.g., as income, or reduction in asset budget contribution) needs to be well-defined.
    *   **Debt Principal vs. Payments:** Budgets track debt *payment expenses*. Changes to underlying debt principal (outside regular payments) don't seem to directly affect budget category progress beyond the expense itself.

4.  **Rollover Logic Implementation Details:**
    *   The precise mechanism, timing, and calculation for `BudgetCategory.rolloverAmount` and its application to subsequent budget periods need verification for robustness.

5.  **Initial Budget Setup with Existing Transactions:**
    *   Ensuring historical transactions within a new budget's first period are correctly reflected in initial `spent` amounts. `TransactionBudgetSyncService` focuses on ongoing changes.

6.  **`expenses-logic.ts` `budgetStatus` TODO:**
    *   The `TODO` for `ExpenseCategory.budgetStatus` highlights that budget vs. actual comparison for expense categories from this module must be handled by an integrating service (e.g., `financial-dashboard-service.ts`).

7.  **Data Integrity for Category Definitions:**
    *   Maintaining consistency between `lib/constants/transaction-categories.ts` and `BudgetCategory.transactionCategories` in Firestore is vital.

8.  **Performance of Recalculations:**
    *   Fetching all transactions for a period on every update in `TransactionBudgetSyncService` could be a performance concern for high-volume users.

9.  **Time Zone and Date Handling:**
    *   Consistent handling of dates for period calculations across different time zones or DST changes is important.
