# AI-First Receipt Scanning Improvements

## What Changed

We've restructured the receipt scanning flow to use **AI-first analysis** instead of OCR-first. This fundamental change dramatically improves accuracy and adds intelligent features.

### Previous Flow (OCR-First)
1. Upload receipt → OCR extracts text → Parse text → AI enhances (if available)
2. **Problem**: AI was limited by OCR quality, couldn't fix fundamental extraction errors

### New Flow (AI-First)
1. Upload receipt → **AI analyzes image directly** → Extract all data → OCR as fallback
2. **Benefit**: AI sees the actual receipt image and can understand context, layout, and details OCR misses

## Key Improvements You'll See

### 1. **Much Better Accuracy**
- AI understands receipt layouts and formats
- Correctly identifies items even with poor image quality
- Handles handwritten additions, stamps, and annotations
- Works with receipts in multiple languages

### 2. **Rich Data Extraction**
Previously extracted:
- Basic merchant name
- Total amount
- Simple item list

Now extracts:
- **Merchant category** (grocery, restaurant, pharmacy, etc.)
- **Merchant address**
- **Receipt number**
- **Cashier name**
- **Item categories** (food, household, etc.)
- **Brand detection**
- **Health scores** for food items (1-10 scale)
- **Payment method** details

### 3. **Intelligent Suggestions**
The AI now provides:
- **Money-saving tips**: "Generic brands available for these items"
- **Health insights**: "Consider healthier alternatives for sugary drinks"
- **Spending insights**: "Large purchase - track this category"
- **Category recommendations**: Auto-suggests the right expense category

### 4. **Visual Feedback**
- Shows "Analyzing receipt with AI..." during processing
- Displays AI insights in a gold-highlighted section
- Shows confidence scores for transparency
- Merchant category displayed as a badge

## How to Test

1. **Ensure you have a Gemini API key** in your `.env.local`:
   ```
   GEMINI_API_KEY=your_key_here
   ```

2. **Upload any receipt** via:
   - Camera capture
   - File upload

3. **Watch the AI in action**:
   - You'll see "Initializing AI Scanner..."
   - Then "Analyzing receipt with AI..."
   - Results will include merchant category and AI insights

## Example Results

### Before (OCR Only):
```
Merchant: MERCADONA
Total: 18.88
Items: 8 items (basic descriptions)
```

### After (AI-First):
```
Merchant: MERCADONA
Category: Grocery Store
Address: AVDA. DE LA FUENTE, S/N, DOS HERMANAS
Total: 18.88
Items: 8 items with:
  - Categories (produce, dairy, etc.)
  - Health scores for food
  - Brand detection

AI Insights:
• Save €2-3 by choosing store brands for milk and yogurt
• Olive oil price is 15% above average - consider buying during promotions
• Healthy choice: Your cart has 60% fresh produce
```

## Configuration Options

In your `.env.local`:
```bash
# Enable/disable AI receipt scanning
NEXT_PUBLIC_AI_RECEIPT_ENABLED=true

# Use AI-first (recommended) or OCR-first approach
NEXT_PUBLIC_AI_FIRST_SCANNING=true
```

## Fallback Behavior

If AI fails or is unavailable:
1. Automatically falls back to traditional OCR
2. No loss of functionality
3. Clear logging shows which method was used

## Cost Considerations

- **Gemini Free Tier**: 15 requests/minute (plenty for personal use)
- **Per Receipt**: 1-2 AI calls maximum
- **Monthly estimate**: ~450 receipts free (typical user: 20-30/month)

## Future Enhancements

With AI-first scanning, we can now add:
- Multi-language receipt support
- Loyalty card detection
- Automatic expense report generation
- Receipt fraud detection
- Split bill calculations
- Warranty tracking
