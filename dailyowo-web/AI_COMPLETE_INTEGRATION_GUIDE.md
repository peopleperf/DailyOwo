# DailyOwo AI Complete Integration Guide

## Overview

The DailyOwo financial app now features comprehensive AI integration across all major features:
- **AI-Enhanced Receipt Scanning** with automatic budget updates
- **AI Financial Insights** on dashboard
- **AI Financial Advisor** accessible from floating action button
- **Smart Budget Category Mapping** for automatic expense categorization

## What Was Fixed

### 1. Receipt-to-Budget Sync Issue

**Problem**: Receipts were being saved but not reflecting in budget spending.

**Root Cause**: Budget categories didn't have transaction categories properly mapped in their `transactionCategories` array.

**Solution**: 
- Created `BudgetCategoryRepairService` to automatically fix existing budgets
- Auto-repair runs when fetching active budgets
- Enhanced error logging for budget sync failures

### 2. AI Integration Issues

**Problem**: AI wasn't working despite implementation due to client-side API key usage.

**Solution**: Created server-side API endpoint `/api/ai/analyze-receipt` for secure AI processing.

## New Features Implemented

### 1. AI Financial Insights Dashboard Card

**Location**: Dashboard
**Features**:
- Real-time financial health metrics
- AI-generated actionable insights
- Budget adherence tracking
- Spending trend analysis
- Confidence scores for each insight

### 2. AI Financial Advisor

**Access**: Floating Action Button → AI Financial Advisor
**Features**:
- Comprehensive financial overview
- Personalized action plans (immediate, short-term, long-term)
- Top priority recommendations
- Interactive tabs for different views

### 3. Smart Category Mapping

**File**: `lib/services/ai-category-mapper.ts`
**Features**:
- Maps AI-detected merchant types to transaction categories
- Provides confidence scores
- Suggests multiple categories with reasoning
- Analyzes individual items for better categorization

## Configuration

### Required Environment Variables

```env
# AI Configuration
GEMINI_API_KEY=your_gemini_api_key_here
NEXT_PUBLIC_AI_ENABLED=true
NEXT_PUBLIC_AI_RECEIPT_ENABLED=true
NEXT_PUBLIC_AI_FIRST_SCANNING=true

# Optional AI Settings
NEXT_PUBLIC_AI_PROVIDER=gemini
NEXT_PUBLIC_AI_INSIGHTS_ENABLED=true
```

## How It Works

### Receipt Scanning Flow

1. User uploads receipt image
2. Image sent to `/api/ai/analyze-receipt` endpoint
3. Gemini Vision API analyzes the image
4. AI extracts:
   - Merchant info and category
   - Individual items with categories
   - Totals validation
   - Financial insights
5. Category mapper suggests appropriate transaction category
6. Transaction saved with proper category
7. Budget automatically updated via `TransactionBudgetSyncService`
8. User sees budget impact in real-time

### Financial Insights Flow

1. `useFinancialData` hook fetches user's financial data
2. AI analyzes:
   - Transaction patterns
   - Budget performance
   - Goal progress
   - Net worth trends
3. Generates actionable insights with confidence scores
4. Updates dashboard metrics
5. Provides personalized recommendations

## User Guide

### Using AI Receipt Scanner

1. Go to Transactions → Add Transaction
2. Click "Scan Receipt" button
3. Upload receipt photo
4. AI analyzes and pre-fills all fields
5. Review AI category suggestions (shown with sparkle icon)
6. Click suggested category to apply
7. Save transaction - budget updates automatically

### Using AI Financial Advisor

1. Click the floating "+" button
2. Select "AI Financial Advisor"
3. View three tabs:
   - **Overview**: Financial snapshot and analysis
   - **Top Priorities**: Most important actions to take
   - **Action Plan**: Structured timeline of tasks
4. Click action buttons to navigate directly to relevant features

### Dashboard AI Insights

- Shows 4 key metrics:
  - Financial Health Score (0-100)
  - Savings Rate
  - Budget Adherence
  - Spending Trend
- Each insight shows confidence level
- Click insights for more details
- Refresh button to regenerate insights

## Troubleshooting

### AI Not Working

1. Check environment variables are set
2. Verify Gemini API key is valid
3. Check browser console for errors
4. Ensure you're on a secure connection (HTTPS)

### Budget Not Updating

1. Check if transaction category is mapped to budget
2. Verify transaction date is within budget period
3. Look for budget sync errors in console
4. Budget categories auto-repair on load

### Receipt Scanning Issues

1. Ensure image is clear and well-lit
2. Receipt should be flat and fully visible
3. Text should be readable
4. Try landscape orientation for wide receipts

## Future Enhancements

1. **Multi-Language Receipt Support**
2. **Voice-Activated Financial Assistant**
3. **Predictive Budget Alerts**
4. **Investment Portfolio Analysis**
5. **Bill Reminder Integration**
6. **Automated Savings Recommendations**

## Development Notes

### Adding New AI Features

1. Create module in `lib/ai/modules/`
2. Implement `AIModule` interface
3. Register in `AIServiceManager`
4. Add UI components as needed
5. Update environment variables if required

### Testing AI Features

```bash
# Set test API key
export GEMINI_API_KEY=your_test_key

# Run in development
npm run dev

# Test receipt scanning
# Upload any receipt image

# Test insights
# Navigate to dashboard

# Test advisor
# Click FAB → AI Financial Advisor
```

## Performance Considerations

- AI insights cached for 5 minutes
- Receipt analysis typically takes 2-3 seconds
- Budget sync happens immediately after transaction save
- All AI calls have timeout of 30 seconds
- Rate limited to prevent API abuse

## Security

- API keys never exposed to client
- All AI processing happens server-side
- User data isolated by authentication
- No financial data stored by AI providers
- Secure HTTPS required for all features
