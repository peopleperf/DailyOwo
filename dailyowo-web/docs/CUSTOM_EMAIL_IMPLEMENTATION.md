# Custom Email Verification Implementation

## Overview

We've successfully implemented a custom email verification system that sends all verification emails from your domain using Resend, completely replacing Firebase's default verification emails from `firebaseapp.com`.

## How It Works

### 1. User Registration Flow
When a user signs up:
- Firebase Authentication creates the user account
- A secure verification token is generated using Web Crypto API
- The token is stored in Firestore with expiration time
- A branded verification email is sent via Resend from your domain
- A welcome email is also sent

### 2. Email Verification Process
- User receives a professional email from your domain (not firebaseapp.com)
- Email contains a verification link pointing to your app
- Clicking the link calls `/api/verify-email` endpoint
- The endpoint validates the token and updates the user's profile
- User is redirected to the verification page with success status

### 3. Access Control
- Users cannot access the app until email is verified
- The auth context checks both Firebase's emailVerified and our custom field
- Unverified users are always redirected to `/verify-email`

## Key Components

### Custom Email Verification Service
`lib/services/custom-email-verification.ts`
- Generates secure tokens
- Stores tokens in Firestore
- Sends verification emails via Resend
- Validates tokens and updates user status

### API Endpoint
`app/api/verify-email/route.ts`
- Handles verification link clicks
- Validates tokens
- Updates user verification status
- Redirects with appropriate status

### Updated Email Template
`emails/VerificationEmail.tsx`
- Supports both verification links and codes
- Matches your premium branding
- Clear call-to-action button

### Auth Context Updates
`lib/firebase/auth-context.tsx`
- Added `emailVerified` field to UserProfile
- Checks custom verification status
- Redirects unverified users appropriately

## Benefits

1. **Professional Branding**: All emails come from your domain
2. **User Trust**: No confusing firebaseapp.com emails
3. **Full Control**: Complete control over email design and content
4. **Flexibility**: Can add custom logic or features
5. **Consistency**: All transactional emails use the same system

## Security Considerations

- Tokens are cryptographically secure (256-bit)
- Tokens expire after 24 hours
- Each token can only be used once
- Tokens are deleted after use
- User profile is updated securely

## Fallback Mechanism

If the custom verification fails, the system falls back to Firebase's verification:
```typescript
try {
  // Custom verification
  await CustomEmailVerificationService.sendVerificationEmail(...)
} catch (error) {
  // Fallback to Firebase
  await sendEmailVerification(result.user)
}
```

## Testing

1. Register a new account
2. Check email for verification from your domain
3. Click the verification link
4. Verify redirect to onboarding
5. Try accessing protected routes without verification

## Future Enhancements

1. **Token Cleanup**: Implement Cloud Function to clean expired tokens
2. **Resend Logic**: Add automatic resend after certain time
3. **Analytics**: Track verification rates
4. **Multi-language**: Support localized verification emails
5. **Custom Expiry**: Allow configurable token expiration

## Maintenance

- Monitor Resend dashboard for email delivery
- Check Firestore for orphaned tokens periodically
- Update email templates as needed
- Keep security dependencies updated
